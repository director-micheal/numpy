# numpy
## What is numpy?
   It's a library for working with arrays and mathematical operations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and is the foundation of most scientific computing in Python.


The lists are slow while numpy is fast because numpy is fixed type 
No type checking when iterating through objects

### List>>>> deletion, insertion, appending, concatenation
### Numpy>>> deletion, insertion, appending, concatenation and a lot more


list>>>> a=[1,3,5]  b =[1,2,3]    a*b=error
Numpy>>> a=np.array([1,3,5])  b =np.array([1,2,3])  a*b=answer
