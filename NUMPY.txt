what is numpy?
   it's a libary for working with arrays and mathematical operations in python. it provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and is the foundation of most scientific computing in python.


List is slow while numpy is fast because, numpy is fixed type 
no type checking when iterating through objects 
contagious memory-- lineup together , simd vector processing ,effective cache utilization.


List>>>> deletion, insertion, appending, concatenation
Numpy>>> deletion, insertion, appending, concatenation and lot more


list>>>> a=[1,3,5]  b =[1,2,3]    a*b=error
Numpy>>> a=np.array([1,3,5])  b =np.array([1,2,3])  a*b=answer
